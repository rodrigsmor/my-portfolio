# About me
My name is Rodrigo, I am a software developer, certified in computer technical course. I am a curious, creative and pro-active professional who is always looking for new experiences, for this reason I developed this portfolio to demonstrate my skills and improve them. I know a lot about software development, having almost two years of professional experience in this area. I code in programming languages like Javascript, Typescript and Java, as well as technologies like HTML, CSS, React, TailwindCSS, Spring and other technologies.
