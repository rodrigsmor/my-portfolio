## 👨🏽‍💻 About me

As mentioned earlier, I’m a full-stack software developer with a strong emphasis on front-end web development. Although my specialisation lies in creating engaging user interfaces, I am equally adept at back-end development and creating mobile applications. My passion for technology is marked by a sincere appreciation for the world of UI/UX design, where I do some work using Figma.

## 📺 How to view

In case you want to take a look at the application, you can access the project at the official link just by [clicking here](https://rm-portfoliof.netlify.app/).

## 🚀 How to run

To install the application, you first need to clone the project to your local device. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/rodrigsmor/my-portfolio.git
```

With the application cloned on your local device, go to the portfolio directory and with the package manager of your choice, run the command to install the project packages.

```
# go to the cloned project directory
cd my-portfolio

# install dependencies
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are effectively installed, you are now fully able to run the application, so just run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

DET: The application will probably be running on `http://localhost:5173/`.
